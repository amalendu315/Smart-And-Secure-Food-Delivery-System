                                ** Prototype Design Features for Patent **

         // This document outlines the key features of a prototype design for a patent application.

    # Key Components to Highlight

    1. **Sensor-Embedded Straps**:
        - Load Cells integrated into carrying straps (or can use something elastic and strong like seat belt).
        - Strain gauges measure weight distribution changes.
        - Data sent to a microcontroller for processing.
        - Provides real-time weight data to the user.
        - Can sense the total weight of the bag and its contents and then match it to the ordered items weight.
        - If weight does not match, it can alert the user and the rider can't start the ride.
        -The strap can also sense if the items are displaced or not during the ride detected by the load cells.

    ## Note :- After a successful order pickup, and start of the ride, and the bag is closed, then if someone tries to open the bag, then our next features will come into play.
    
    2. **Tamper-Evident Closure**:
        - Magnetic reed switches along bag opening to detect the number of times the bag is opened.
        - If the bag is opened more than once, it can alert the user and the rider.
        - If the rider can explain why the bag was opened, then the ride can continue.
        - If the rider cannot explain, then its up to the user to decide whether to continue or cancel the ride because we will be alerting the user with timestamps of the opening and closing of the bag and if the items are displaced or not.

    3. **Modular Electronics Bay**:
        - Waterproof compartment for ESP32, battery, and other electronics.
        - Access Panel for easy maintenance.
        - Anti-vibration mounting to protect electronics.

    4. **Impact Resistance Zones**:
        - Reinforced corners with MPU6050 accelerometer to detect impacts.
        - Shock-absorbing materials to protect contents.
