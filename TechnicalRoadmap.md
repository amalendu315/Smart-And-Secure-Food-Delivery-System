# 🚀 Smart Food Delivery System: Technical Roadmap

## 📌 Project Vision
Build a sensor-integrated smart delivery bag and companion mobile app to ensure safe, tamper-proof, and high-integrity food delivery for premium users.

---

## 📅 Phase 1: Research & Planning (Week 1–3)

### ✅ Deliverables:
- Finalize product specs and features
- Research patents and similar products
- Shortlist sensors and microcontrollers
- Recruit core tech + hardware team

### 🔧 Tools/Technologies:
- Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore – for technical research
- Figma, Miro – to create UX flow and diagrams

---

## 📦 Phase 2: Hardware Prototype v1 (Week 4–8)

### ✅ Deliverables:
- Design smart bag layout with sensor placements
- Build a working circuit for:
  - Strap detection
  - Item count via load/pressure sensors
  - Tamper detection using motion sensors
- Rechargeable battery integration

### 🔧 Technologies:
- 🧠 **Microcontroller**: ESP32 (Wi-Fi + Bluetooth)
- 📦 **Sensors**:
  - Load cell with HX711 amplifier – item count detection
  - Hall effect sensor – for strap status (open/closed)
  - MPU-6050 – accelerometer + gyroscope for tamper detection
- 🔋 Li-ion battery + TP4056 charger module
- 🧰 Platform: Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for firmware
- 🛠️ 3D-printed housing + foam-insulated food bag

---

## 📲 Phase 3: Mobile App (Week 6–10, parallel)

### ✅ Deliverables:
- User login (Gold/premium users)
- Order lifecycle tracking
- Real-time strap status, alerts
- Integrity summary after delivery

### 🔧 Technologies:
- **Frontend**: Flutter (cross-platform, fast dev)
- **Backend**: Firebase + Firestore DB
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- **Hardware communication**: Bluetooth BLE integration for data pull

---

## 🌐 Phase 4: Cloud Dashboard + API (Week 8–12)

### ✅ Deliverables:
- Restaurant and admin dashboard
- API endpoints for:
  - Order confirmation
  - Sensor data sync
  - Delivery status logging

### 🔧 Technologies:
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or Firestore if using Firebase)
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live delivery alerts
- **Hosting**: Vercel (web), Heroku or Firebase Hosting

---

## 🛠️ Phase 5: Hardware-Software Integration (Week 10–13)

### ✅ Deliverables:
- Pair bag with app and sync sensor readings
- Alert user in real time during delivery
- Data logging + integrity score generation

### 🔧 Tools:
- BLE data reader in Flutter
- MQTT (optional) for low-latency sync
- Custom firmware with OTA update support (ESP32)

---

## 🎯 Phase 6: Pilot Launch (Week 14–16)

### ✅ Deliverables:
- 10 smart bags deployed
- Partner 5 premium restaurants in a small zone
- Collect user feedback + improve UX/hardware
- Track delivery behavior and sensor accuracy

---

## 💰 Optional: Monetization Layer (Post-MVP)

### Features:
- Monthly subscription model for premium integrity tracking
- Loyalty perks for restaurants using smart bags
- Trust ratings and tipping incentives
